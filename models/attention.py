    Applies an dot product attention mechanism on the output features from the decoder.

    Args:
        dim(int): The number of expected features in the output

    Inputs: decoder_output, encoder_output
        - **decoder_output** (batch, output_len, hidden_size): tensor containing the output features from the decoder.
        - **encoder_output** (batch, input_len, hidden_size): tensor containing features of the encoded input sequence.Steps to be maintained at a certain number to avoid extremely slow learning

    Outputs: output, attn
        - **output** (batch, output_len, dimensions): tensor containing the attended output features from the decoder.
